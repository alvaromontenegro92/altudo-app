## Overview
The main objective of this challenge is to develop a web application that would accept a web URL and can display all of images used on the page and select the top 10 used words in the all text of the page.
There are some solutions for this problem using libraries made from 3rd-party developers/companies like HTML Agility Pack, TidyNet.Tidy, mshtml, HTMLDocument, etc.
Despite these solutions, I've decided to create my own solution due to I could avoid any bugs or bad performance from 3rd-party libraries.
